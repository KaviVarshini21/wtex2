                <p>  It all started in 1933, when Sol Koffler put his life savings on the line to start a luggage company in Providence,Rhode Island. His dream was to build a tough suitcase that could sell for a dollar. He succeeded, and decades of innovation followed… By 1945, air travel was taking off and lighter luggage was in high demand. So American Tourister’s Hi-Taper was designed – tapered luggage that was lighter and easier to pack. The 50’s found the company experimenting with new materials to make the world’s first molded luggage. The distinctive modern design could really take a beating.</p>
